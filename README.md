# ImageMult4
This simple project helps to locate all image files on the Assets folders of your Unity Projects, display the image dimensions and suggest the best dimension (nearest multiple of 4).

Why?
With the images being multiple of 4, you can profit from Unity's compression algorith and have insane image dimensions with ridiculous file size.
